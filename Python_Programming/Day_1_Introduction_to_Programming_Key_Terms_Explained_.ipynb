        "|------|-------------|\n",
        "| **Program** | A set of instructions written in a programming language to perform a task. |\n",
        "| **Programming Language** | A language like Python, Java, or C++ used to write programs. Python is beginner-friendly. |\n",
        "| **Code** | The actual instructions you write in a programming language. |\n",
        "| **Syntax** | The set of rules for how code must be written. Just like grammar in English. |\n",
        "| **Compiler / Interpreter** | Tools that convert your code into machine language so the computer can execute it. Python uses an interpreter. |\n",
        "| **Script** | A small piece of code written to automate a task. |\n",
        "| **Execution** | The act of running a program so that the computer performs the instructions. |\n",
        "| **Error / Bug** | A mistake or flaw in your code that causes it to behave unexpectedly. |\n",
        "| **Debugging** | The process of finding and fixing errors in your code. |\n",
        "| **Algorithm**\t| Step-by-step solution to a problem. |\n",
        "| **Pseudocode** |\tHuman-readable version of the algorithm |\n",
        "| **Flowchart** |\tDiagrammatic representation of the algorithm. |\n",

        "| **Variable** | A container used to store data. Example: `age = 25` |\n",
        "| **Data Types** | The kind of value a variable holds: integer, string, float, boolean, etc. |\n",
        "| **Operators** | Symbols that perform operations: `+` for addition, `==` for comparison, etc. |\n",
        "| **Expression** | A combination of variables and operators that produces a value. Example: `a + b` |\n",
        "| **Statement** | A complete line of code that performs an action. Example: `print(\"Hello\")` |\n",
        "| **Function** | A reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Example: `len(\"Hello\")` |\n",
        "| **Arguments** | Values passed into a function. Example: In `print(\"Hi\")`, `\"Hi\"` is the argument. |\n",
        "| **Return Value** | The output a function gives back. Example: `max(3, 4)` returns `4`. |\n",

        "| **Conditionals** | Make decisions in code using `if`, `else`, and `elif`. |\n",
        "| **Loops** | Repeat actions using `for` and `while` loops. |\n",
        "| **Break/Continue** | `break` exits a loop early, `continue` skips the current loop iteration. |\n",

        "| **Tuple** | Like a list but cannot be changed (immutable). Example: `(1, 2)` |\n",
        "| **Dictionary** | A collection of key-value pairs. Example: `{\"name\": \"Suhas\"}` |\n",
        "| **Set** | A collection of unique items. Example: `{1, 2, 3}` |\n",
